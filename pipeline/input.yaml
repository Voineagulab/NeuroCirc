    -   name: "CircRNA expression in human brain tissue"
        datasets: [Brain1.CTX.CB, Brain2.DLPFC]
        description: >
            This section allows detailed exploration of the data in the Brain1.CTX.CB (<a href=Brain1.CTX.CB>Gokool et al.</a>) dataset. 
            CircRNA expression values (in Counts per Million ; CPM) and circularization index values (CI) can be plotted against 
            metadata variables selected from the drop-down menu. A boxplot is generated for categorical metadata variables and a 
            scatterplot is generated for numerical variables. In the case of numerical variables, a second categorical variable can 
            be selected to color the datapoints â€“ eg. CI vs Age plot with data points colored by Brain Region.
            A scatterplot of circular RNA vs linear RNA expression shows the relationship between circRNA expression in CPM and the 
            parental linear RNA expression quantified based on the expression of the upstream and downstream linear junctions (SJ), normalised as CPM.
            SNPs associated with the expression of the circRNAs are displayed in a table, with data from Brain2.DLPFC 
            (<a href=Brain2.DLPFC>Liu et al.</a>).

    -   name: "CircRNA expression during neuronal differentiation"
        datasets: [NeurDiff1.hESC, NeurDiff2.SY5Y]
        description: >
           This section includes interactive plots that allow the user to explore the expression of the circRNA of interest (CPM) 
           in the NeurDiff1.hESC and NeurDiff2.SY5Y datasets. NeurDiff1.hESC contains circRNA expression data from human ES cells 
           and forebrain neurons differentiated for 14 days from <a href=NeurDiff1.hESC>Zhang et al. 2016</a>. NeurDiff2.SY5Y includes circRNA expression data 
           from SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, differentiated for 2, 4 or 8 days from <a href=NeurDiff2.SY5Y>Rybak-Wolf et al. 2015</a>.

    -   name: "CircRNA expression during cellular maturation in brain organoids"
        datasets: [OrgMaturation]
        description: > 
            This section displays circRNA expression during organoid maturation in tyrosine-hydroxylase positive neurons 
            and astrocytes. RNA -seq data has been generated by <a href=OrgMaturation>Sloan et al. 2017</a> and the circRNA 
            quantification has been reported in <a href=Brain1.CTX.CB>Gokool et al. 2020</a>.

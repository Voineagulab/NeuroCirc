            This section allows detailed exploration of the data in the Brain1.PFC-CB (Gokool et al.[link to pub]) dataset. CircRNA expression values (in Counts per Million ; CPM) and circularization index values (CI)  can be plotted against metadata variables selected from the drop-down menu. A boxplot is generated for categorical metadata variables and a scatterplot is generated for numerical variables. In the case of numerical variables, a second categorical variable can be selected to color the datapoints â€“ eg. CI vs Age plot with data points colored by Brain Region.
            A scatterplot of circular RNA vs linear RNA expression shows the relation
            SNPs associated with the expression of the circRNAs are displayed in a table, with data from Brain2. DLPFC (Liu et al. [link to pub]).
